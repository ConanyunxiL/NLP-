It does not scale up later as you increase your DPS by other means.  Yes, technically every subsequent DR or EDR after your first is including earlier ones in the calculation, however, by the time you can pull off another EDR, the power of your first one has been reduced to an insignificant figure. So instead of two EDRs being simply 1.1 x 1.1=1.1025 of your current DPS, it's actually more like 1.1 x 1.0000001 = 1.10000011, which in terms of significant figures is practically the same thing as a 1.1 bonus.

You can do the same test. A simple example version is to level every hero to exactly lvl.200 up through Frostleaf, do EDR, level frostleaf to 300, and write down your DPS. Reset, do another run, take everyone to 200, take frostleaft to 300, and THEN to EDR.

I learned a lot by reading [Mindfulness in Plain English](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html) (there's a free online version on the page, too!), and since I'm somewhat interested in Zen Buddhism, I do [Zazen](http://zmm.mro.org/teachings/meditation-instructions/) - although I'm sitting not nearly as often as I'd like to. There are a lot of great resources online, like [calm.com](http://www.calm.com/) - even with guided meditations.

If you have more time on the day, try to meditate longer - but if you don't have it, at least do it for this single minute. It's not about meditating for as long as you can before starving, or moving to some transcendental planes. First, it's just about building the habit (this will take about four weeks) and getting the hang of it. The latter depends on your method, maybe you need just an hour to understand it, maybe even months.  \n",

Since I broke my habit streak, I'm back at square one and don't do it every day - this is why it's important to make meditation a habit. ;) While I own a zafu (sitting cushion) and a zabuton (larger cushion for the knees and ankles) in combination with a somewhat fixed place in the house, Zazen is about the sitting itself and can be done without them.  \n",

What I find pitying about Othello's character is how he falls for Iago's tricks. I always thought this story was a lot about culture shock for Othello - Good Venetian women dressed pretty showy and promiscuously in that day, quite like prostitutes/corteseans and it was sometimes hard to distinguish the two  so of course I think Othello was going to be easy to manipulate as a foreigner which Iago exploited, and in that sense Othello deserves a bit of pity, but i agree with you, Othello took to acts of violence (which sort of mirrors the image he had set when he was introduced) so he played into Iago's plans. I would consider him a tragic hero. At the end, unlike most tragic hero's, he kills himself in the most gruesome way, ever, which i think was created as a sort of penance for his mishaps - perhaps that makes up for it?

The spirit suddenly came out of its cave and appeared dressed with bright feathers and war paint. The Spaniards attempted to offer it gifts and tribute, but the spirit refused these offerings and made motions for the intruders to leave. One of the Spaniards managed to lasso this spirit with a lariat and the spirit shouted to be released. When the Indians of the area were told about this incident, they pointed to the mountain and muttered “cucusy.” The Spaniards translated this word as meaning “devil.

This is the lazy-man approach but validates the need for recorded room tone.\n",

            "The way I cut dialog (and teach it to others) is based on filling individual tracks. For example, let's say you are using lavs for a scene (yuck). There are four characters and their iso's are cut on four or more different tracks because the mixer will automate his/her EQs/compressors/de-essers differently for each mic depending on its tonal characteristics. So fill from each mic is needed, not just the boom. If you record 30 seconds of roomtone BEFORE shooting, then you can record all the mics... but I've never seen this on set. Usually you have to beg for room tone, and it often happens after some or all of the actors are on their way out.\n",

            "So next you ask, what if the boom is used to cut a scene? Surely room tone is useful then. You start with the wide (Sc26_T1) on track one, then you have 26A on track 2, 26B on track 3, and so on based on angles, roomtone shifts, and perspective. You need fill from each angle to make the edit seamless, as 26A might be facing a refrigerator and 26B facing away. The recorded roomtone will likely match one or none of the angles, as mic placement, lights, and ambient sound levels will have changed through the course of shooting the scene.\n",

            "The goal with this approach to dialog editing is to make each track sound smooth on its own, then make all of the tracks sound smooth together. It limits the build-up of noise due to using only what's necessary for a smooth edit. When the re-recording mixer starts his/her predub, this speeds up the workflow immensely and ultimately produces an awesome sounding dialog stem. A single angle/track of tone will probably not be sufficient to make this work. Though I always check it with hopeful ears, most of the time I rely on fill-within-the-takes to cut dialog.\n",

            "Sander's is running a legislative platform for the presidency, which is common these days. Many of his proposals would require significant legislative action. For example, Sanders is running a universal education plan would require a significant restructuring of the financial aid apparatus, changes to the revenue code, and likely the creation of a new agency to oversee it. He is also running a major legislative plan to break-up the banks. He is on the record of supporting another major overhaul of the healthcare system, which would likely require a repeal and replace of the ACA. He would like to see significant changes to early-year childcare and regulations on maternity and paternity leave, which would require significant legislative pushes.\n",

            "The problem is, Sanders is not running for a legislative position, he is running for the executive. Every major policy proposal he has put forward would be almost like another ACA, a massive change to existing structures that requires significant coordination with a legislature that is not as committed to the policies as Sanders would be and that is likely to be hostile (even if the Dems make gains during his presidency).\n",
            "\n",
            "That means that most of the 'simple' and 'common-sense' proposals Sanders puts forward in his presidency are, ultimately, out of his hands. He can recommend them, he can find friends in the legislature that help craft the legislation he wants, but ultimately all he can do is apply political pressure. With a hostile legislature, this is likely to lead to a lot of, as /u/Honest_Discussion suggests, 'non-stop gridlock, whining, and finger pointing'. If Sanders is able to get half of his policy proposals through the legislature, they will in the end rely on 'imperfect deals' that resemble the original intent only if you squint hard enough.\n",

He may have policy recommendations closest to your interests, and if he does than by all means vote for him. But don't expect anything close to the high expectations many will have for him if he wins, because he simply can't achieve it. To the extent he can, it will require a lot of nasty and back-room politics to get there—and 'there' will not be what you voted for.\n",

But I personally think Sanders will be unlikely to yield these results. He's a populist legislator, and its telling that while he has a lot of big legislative plans he hasn't taken the lead in achieving them in the 24 years he's been there.

            "\n",
            ">Yepun’s laser beam crosses the majestic southern sky and creates an artificial star at an altitude of 90 km high in the Earth's mesosphere. The Laser Guide Star (LGS) is part of the VLT’s adaptive optics system and is used as a reference to correct the blurring effect of the atmosphere on images. The colour of the laser is precisely tuned to energise a layer of sodium atoms found in one of the upper layers of the atmosphere — one can recognise the familiar colour of sodium street lamps in the colour of the laser. This layer of sodium atoms is thought to be a leftover from meteorites entering the Earth’s atmosphere. When excited by the light from the laser, the atoms start glowing, forming a small bright spot that can be used as an artificial reference star for the adaptive optics. Using this technique, astronomers can obtain sharper observations. For example, when looking towards the centre of our Milky Way, researchers can better monitor the galactic core, where a central supermassive black hole, surrounded by closely orbiting stars, is swallowing gas and dust. question answer                          label: question                prediction: answer\n",

What you first need to do is a \"filler\" color. I chose to color my hair a dirty blonde, dark blonde color close to my natural hair color.  It was ugly. Haha! I haven't seen my natural color in so long, I hated it. I left it alone for a day. For that, I did use a stupid box of Revlon. I HATE box dyes, but I couldn't get to Sally's. (Your best bet would be to try and ask people at Sally's what you need. You will not need a high developer. A 10 or 20 volume should suffice. The higher volumes would be for lifting. You aren't lifting, you are depositing!) At Sally's, they have a protein filler. You need that. After you dye your hair with the dark blonde color of your choice, you'll need a protein filler. Follow the instructions. Some say to rinse and some say to leave it in and use it as a base for your dye. Choose your red color. I personally absolutely love ion. This time, like I said, I didn't get to Sally's. I used a box of Feria for my red. It was a darker color. That has since faded. To spruce it up and brighten it to what I wanted originally, I picked up some Splat in Crimson obsession and went over it. (I actually just did it tonight!) Now it's pretty close to what I'd wanted, and close to your picture of the red you want. If you really wanna do all this work yourself, this is what I've done. Now.. Sally's has wonderful products you should definitely use. There are also stain remover wipes (you may need them) and definitely get the black gloves. Mixing bowls and brushes for dying are a must. Sally's does not carry boxed colors like you are asking about. You would have to mix your own dyes. The bowls have lines and measuring is a bit easy, as it is a 1:1 ratio. If you do it yourself and succeed, please update! I hope I helped some.  answer elaboration                          label: answer                prediction: elaboration\n",

Abrasive and rude as a convicted felon can get, Jack is \"volunteering\" at the Institute to avoid a trip to the big house. Despite her history, Jackie is often seen delivering food to Tabitha, Jeff, and other children on their treatment days. Jeff noted that each meal came with a cute doodle or a pretty origami crane. When Jeff confronted her about her preferential treatment, Jackie shrugged it off saying that she likes kids, since they're easier to talk to than adults and they understand what she wants. \"I just wanna be free, kid...more ways than one.\"\n",

            "**Jacob Taylor**: Jeff's physical therapist is John Tyler. A firm believer in the \"Anyone can better themselves\" mantra, John openly respects and even admires Jeff's optimistic attitude. He chose to be a physical trainer to help kids especially, admitting that he and his father are not on speaking terms. He pushes himself so he can be a better man than his father.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Samara**: Dr. Samantha Rogers is one of the three board doctors that oversee major decision-making at the Shepard Institute. A wise woman who, at times, is kind and motherly and at other times cold and distant. She's respected by the Institute's doctors for abstaining from any favoritism when it comes to breaking of protocol, but she's also feared as she's swift to deliver suspensions for even minor infractions of said medical protocols.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Kasumi Goto**: Mitsune Kiru is a spunky, silver-tongued intern. While she means well and admires what the Institute and its staff does, Mitsune tends to have a very \"laid-back\" work ethic and is often seen cat-napping in the strangest of places. She's almost never caught, much to her ill-conceived pride, and her innocent demeanor and persuasive excuses can even throw off Dr. Rogers at times. Jeff always feels the need to check his pockets, after he talks to her.\n",

A member of an elite team of Australian soldiers sent to Vietnam during the war, he was the only one of his squad who survived a vicious ambush. He's often seen with Donald, trading war stories. Normally proud and boastful, the proud warrior grows melancholic whenever he mentions a Lt. \"Vido\". He's currently trying to get his old war rifle shipped from Australia.\n",

            "**Legion**: Larry Jenkins was a computer technician before he was admitted to the Shepard Institute to treat his malformed heart. Treatments have only been mildly effective and his doctors told him that he needed a transplant to live past a few more years. His rare blood type and dilated arteries make finding a donor heart extremely difficult, despite this, Larry has already passed up three matching hearts telling himself and his doctors that there are people who need it more urgently than him. Jeff befriends him when they meet in a quiet part of the Institute's gardens. Larry has been continuously trying to befriend Tabitha, but she's frightened by Larry's ghastly, gaunt appearance, convinced he's a ghost or a monster. He confides in Jeff his fear that there's no life after death and his actions in the world could be meaningless.\n",

Although stone-faced, Hackett is infamous for his \"Hack it out.\" joke during his surgical consultations. Hackett takes a shining to Jeff after he talks to the boy about his future surgical options, and Jeff in return finds some comfort that his surgeon can still laugh at his job.\n",

            "**Ken & Gabby**: The inseparable nurse pair are almost always working on paperwork at nurse station three. Even Doctor Nagali acknowledges that they somehow work much more competently together. Ken regularly plays cards with the other nurses, and promises to teach Jeff how to play poker, when he's older. Unbeknownst to the pair, there is rumor that several doctors are betting whether they finally work out that \"unresolved sexual tension\" within the next year.\n",

            "**EDI**: Edith was a miracle born from tragedy. The sole survivor of a tragic aviation disaster, Edith was in a medically-induced coma for five months as doctor's worked to salvage what they could and remove what they couldn't. When she awoke, she was in the sterile white rooms of Shepard Institute, disoriented, unable to move, and alone. Prosthetic limbs still needed to be created, a process of a few weeks, and even then, Edith showed little motivation to do much of anything besides eat, drink, and breathe, let alone go through rigorous physical therapy. Then Dr. T'Soni brought her Joker in; however, to her dismay, Jeff and Edith didn't get along at all. Edith's cold criticisms drawing blood on Jeff's patience. Despite the pleas from Dr. T'Soni, Jeff refused to acknowledge Edith at all afterwards. It was only until Jeff's wheelchair battery ran out outside of her room did the pair finally begin to talk. It was a tense, awkward conversation, until Jeff made his signature snide commentary on the situation. And then a small giggle broke the silence between them. Then a chuckle. Then hardy laughter. Edith was laughing, smiling for the first time in a long time. Jeff would and probably never will admit it, but Edith looked kinda cute when she was smiling. The two would become close friends, helping each other through each others' physical therapy, hoping that, eventually, she can ride on the back of Jeff's wheelchair.      \n",

            "**Javik**: Dr. James Victus is as close to a celebrity as one can get in the Institute. A world-renowned expert on degenerative diseases, Dr. Victus only recently became a member of the Shepard Institute. Dr. T'Soni was initially excited to work with the bespectacled man whose works she studied ever so carefully, but as she continued to observe her idol she realized that Dr. Victus came short of her expectations. He spoke tersely and often relegated most of his patients to other doctors and staff members so he can spend more time in the research labs. Instead of assisting her with oversight of her patients, Dr. Victus constantly criticized and berated Dr. T'Soni for her \"disgustingly unprofessional\" repertoire with them. The pair often fiercely argued over treatment methods and Dr. T'Soni's disappointment and bitter contempt for her fallen idol was not lost on her patients.  However, Jeff notices that Victus does openly acknowledge T'Soni's skills as a physician and often cedes to T'Soni's judgement in their arguments, leaving Jeff confused as to why the pair can't work better together.\n",

            "**Richard Jenkins**: Richard Jenkins only met Jeff once, sitting in a waiting room together they shared a few jokes.  Most of what he knows about the man were from off-hand remarks by Dr. T'Soni. Jenkins was an incredibly spirited young man who was ready to take on the field of medicine with a fresh mind. He worked under Dr. T'Soni for a short time and showed incredible compassion and promise, but when a small yet critical error in judgement caused the death of a patient, Jenkins broke down. While he was granted a reprieve from the board for his mistake, Jenkins received no such atonement from his own conscience and resigned altogether from the Institute.  other announcement                          label: other                prediction: announcement\n",

One is that it causes your eyes to focus on the screen differently than usual to see the 3D and the movements of characters in said 3D motion; very similar to making your eyes go cross-eyed to see. The second reason is if you have any type of eye problem such as; near-sighted, far-sighted, eye astigmatisms, etc. then it makes your eyes behave in a way that you cannot grasp the 3D image for very long without it giving off this 'stinging' feeling to your cornea.

But at 2 months, the median was down to 1 per day, with a range of 1 every 7+ days to 8 per day. The population studied was a Turkish population in which 78% were exclusively breastfed to 4 months, at which point weaning foods were commonly started. When only looking at breastfed babies 0-4 months, the median stooling frequency was 3 times per day with a range of 1 every 7+ days to 12 per day, compared to mixed fed babies who had a median of 1 per day with a range of 1 every 4 days to 8 per day.

The percentage of infants who passed stool less than once a day was very low in infants aged 1 month (0.9%), but this increased sharply at the second month (39.3%). After 4–6 months, it decreased again to 25.6%, 21.1%, and 12.2% at 4–6 months, 9–12 months, and 18–24 months, respectively.

In our study, the median number of stools in the first month of life was 6 (range: 0.5–12). In the second month, it decreased to once a day and remained almost the same until the end of 2 years of life. **Interestingly, in the second month, more than a third of infants passed less than one stool each day.** This finding has been observed in our clinical practice when the parents of these rare-stooling infants applied with the complaint of constipation. These infants were defecating once every 3–4 days, although the stool consistency was normal. In their study, performed on 240 infants aged 2–20 weeks, Weaver et al. demonstrated that the stool frequency decreased to half after the first month both in breast-fed and formula-fed infants [21]. **The high frequency of defecation in early life is thought to be related to immaturity of the gut and breast feeding [8, 21, 22]. The age-related decline in the frequency of stools points toward a maturation of the water-conserving capacity of the gut. The passive permeability and active absorptive mechanisms of the neonatal gut change with postnatal age [21].**\n",

The homogeneous and spiritual brilliance is the One Mind, while the six harmoniously blended 'elements' are the six sense organs. These six sense organs become severally united with objects that defile them -- the eyes with form, the ear with sound, the nose with smell, the tongue with taste, the body with touch, and the thinking mind with entities. Between these organs and their objects arise the six sensory perceptions, making eighteen sense-realms in all. If you understand that these eighteen realms have no objective existence, you will bind the six harmoniously blended 'elements' into a single spiritual brilliance -- a single spiritual brilliance which is the One Mind. All students of the Way know this, but cannot avoid forming concepts of 'a single spiritual brilliance' and 'the six harmoniously blended elements.' Accordingly they are chained to entities and fail to achieve a tacit understanding of original mind.\"\n",

Once you start getting the hang of Linear Algebra, I find Gel'fand's [Lectures on Linear Algebra](http://www.amazon.com/Lectures-Linear-Algebra-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486660826) to be an absolute beast of a book. It's not great for learning things the first time round, but when you sorta know some of the stuff already, it's a great reference since it's so concise and clearly written. It also dispenses with the irritating emphasis on actual numerical exercises, instead focusing on formal manipulation of the symbols, which will serve you far better in Physics than calculating the determinant of 20 random 3 x 3 matrices. answer elaboration                          label: answer                prediction: elaboration\n",

When your opponent can take you out in TWO SHOTS, and is hiding behind a wall in which you cannot touch them until you take out that wall... things do not look good for you.

Additionally, this is why it is recommended for .52 gal users to wear one damage up main.\n",

            "* This is one of the lesser mobile shooter class weapons, as it decreases running speed while firing to a lesser speed than that of the splattershots and the n-zaps, which are equal range.

            "* This gun sacrifices accuracy for power, an as such, you may be depending on RNG to not fail you in some 1v1s. The splash wall is one way to deal with this - you can get more shots off while protecting yourself in case RNG fails you.\n",

MCW has a chance to do just that, and the Bucks will hope that less scoring pressure and plenty of hard work can help him bring those shooting percentages up to reasonable levels while enabling guys like Giannis and Jabari to feast off his instinctive abilities as a passer. For inspiration he only needs to look at Kidd's career: Both piled up assists and bricked jump shots at prodigious rates early in their careers, but Kidd eventually developed a reliable three-point stroke to complement his playmaking wizardry and defensive dynamism.

I can feel the end of days approaching and I just want to be alone and cry.  But with that being said, if I'm going to go down, I'm going down swinging. This may be my downfall, but I won't let this get the best of me. I may be stuck in a rut, by I'll do everything I can to give my depression hell before it gets the best of me, and I hope you all do the same. announcement question                          label: announcement                prediction: question\n",

            "1.) Agreed, don't minor/major. I would enter the school in the BSGD program and see how you like the design classes after the first year. You'll be taking the same programming courses as the CS people for at least that first year, then you can decide which one has really grabbed your interest. (This is exactly what I did, I switched into the BSCSRTIS major after the first semester because I found I love coding!)\n",
            "\n",
            "2.) The workload is really all dependent on how well you manage your time. If you put off your classwork to work on your game (more than you should be at least) you'll find yourself struggling to keep up VERY quickly. The work can pile up in the blink of an eye. Having a background with computers of course is going to help you (at least help you quickly grasp DigiPen's own software), but if you're already a coding wizz you may find yourself bored with some of the earlier classes which aim to teach someone who has never coded before.\n",

            "3.) Again it's all dependent on how you manage the work they throw at you. You'll find yourself with a fair amount of free time, meaning you'll still get to game now and then, but that free time is also the time you have to work on your Game (which is worked on ALMOST ENTIRELY in your free time). So technically you will have NO free time, but realistically you will find time to relax and do things, as long as you aren't trying to cram (as MC_GD said).\n",

            "4.) Don't expect frats/sororities, we don't have any. And while we do have clubs, they aren't extremely active beyond a handful (i.e. Game Choir, Anime club). We do have LAN parties at the school from time to time, I mean real, awesome, school-wide, all-nighter LAN parties. There are also plenty of Company Days where we'll get to meet some devs, but those are usually reserved for upperclassmen (Junior and above).\n",
            "\n",
            "5.) You'd actually be surprised how many girls there are in the BFA program, although you'll find it hard to make time to interact with them since our class schedules differ so much. From my experience, every girl I met that was in my degree program was dating someone by the end of the first semester. Try to get to know people before the semester starts, throw some small get together's to try and meet some people and make some friends. I threw a Magic the Gathering party about a week before my first semester started and met the guys I'm now on a Game team with, AND a girl (we dated for about a month before I realized I couldn't manage having a girlfriend and dealing with the workload I'd accepted, but that's because I'm terrible at time management).\n",

You continue to rise and fall as wave, but you experience yourself as boundless ocean. This is indeed the whole point of meditation, and it really happens to ordinary people. It's why it's worthwhile taking a little time to sit every day.

I had the night off from work and, as opposed to being the social butterfly my parents had always wanted, I found myself lazily flicking through the channels on the tv, my tee shirt speckled with bits of each meal I had eaten throughout the day. So things were going great. \n",
            "   \n",
            "After several minutes of surfing the channels, finding nothing that struck my interest, I put it on the news and grabbed the book I had been reading from the coffee table, turning to the dog-eared page and sighing as the anchorwoman droned on in the background. I kept catching bits of the news as I turned the pages. \"....World Cup bid.....tension building in Middle East.....clean water initiative....\" \n",
            "   \n",
            "As I turned the page, the lights flickered. I raised my head, wondering if I'd forgotten to pay the electricity bill, at which point I was plunged into darkness. \"Yup....way to go Jane,\" I said aloud. I sighed, getting up off the couch and slowly, carefully made my way to the kitchen, opening a cabinet and getting out a flash light, clicking it on and moving the beam across the dark, empty apartment. And in the darkness, the silence deafening, I kinda wished I was the social butterfly my parents had wanted. Perhaps then, I wouldn't be standing here alone, food and sweat stains covering my shirt. \n",
            "   \n",
            "Seeing as I had no power, I decided it would be best to go out tonight. I went upstairs to my bedroom and tried my best to assemble an outfit in the darkness, the flashlight not providing nearly enough light for me to do my makeup. I hoped and prayed I wouldn't end up looking like a clown as I got ready, putting on what I assumed were blue jeans and a basic white tee shirt. \n",
            "   \n",
            "As I slipped my black and white Chucks on, I begin to hear a sound in my backyard. It was a low sound at first but it got increasingly loud, like some great mechanical beast wheezing. As the sound grew to a crescendo, I looked out the window into the backyard at which point the lone tree in my backyard was blown to smithereens, a flash of blue all I saw before I shielded my eyes. Then all was silent again. \n",
            "   \n",
            "I cautiously peeked out the window and saw, of all things, a police box sitting in the remains of the tree, brilliant orange and yellow light pouring out of the windows. I ran downstairs to the patio doors and flashed the beam of the light out onto the police box, smoke coming off of it. I opened the doors and quietly stepped out into the dark. \n",
            "   \n",
            "\"My god,\" I said as I surveyed the damage. Branches and leaves lie scattered all around the yard, but I was paying more attention to the box in the tree. The orange and yellow light was no longer pouring out of the windows, but smoke poured out of the crack between the doors. Suddenly, the doors were thrown open and someone fell out, hitting the ground with a groan and a thud. I gasped, flashing my beam on them. It was a man, his clothes in tatters. I frantically fished my phone out of my pocket to dial 911 and frowned as I found it was turned off. \"Weird...\" I thought. I cautiously stepped towards the man, his short, dark red hair blowing softly in the wind. \n",
            "\"A-are you okay sir?\" I asked. He groaned in response. I stepped closer and kneeled, turning him over, shocked to find that despite his clothes being all but destroyed, his face appeared fine. He had a thick red beard, one that hadn't been shaved in several days. His ivory skin was almost too intense to flash the beam of light on. His dark green eyes slowly opened and then, seeing me, they shot open. \n",
            "   \n",
            "He jumped up with surprising dexterity for a man who'd just suffered a terrible crash. He looked at me and then began examining himself, making sure he was uninjured. I stood there frozen, unable to speak. Satisfied that he was okay, the man turned towards the police box in the tree. \"You have got to be kidding me,\" he said in a thick Scottish accent. He turned towards me. \"Can you believe this?!\" he said incredulously, gesturing to the box. I really couldn't. He sighed. \"Well, that's just great.\" He turned toward me again, his eyes narrowing. \"Why do you keep doing that? I don't like it,\" he said. \n",
            "   \n",
            "\"Wh-what are you talking about?\" I managed to say. \n",
            "\"That blurry thing. You're all fuzzy! It really is very distracting.\" He turned back towards the box. \"Oh, not you too!\" he shouted at it. He walked over to me, his long, thin legs carrying him to me in seconds. \"I need your car blur person.\" \n",
            "\"F-for what?\" I asked, still not sure if I was dreaming. \"Need to get the TARDIS out of the tree.\" \n",
            "\"T-TARDIS?\" \n",
            "\"Oh, for God's sake! Can you manage a single bloody sentence without stammering?!\" That made me mad. \n",
            "\"Hey, you're the one who crashed into my backyard,\" I yelled. He looked surprised at that. \n",
            "\"Backyard? Where are we? When are we?\" \n",
            "\"What are you, daft?\" I said. \"New York City, 2015. \n",
            "\"If we're in New York City in 2015,\" he said, \"then why are there no lights for miles around?\" He asked. And for the first time, I noticed that it wasn't just my apartment. The city was dark as far as the eye could see. \"My god...\" I said. I turned back towards the man, but he wasn't there. I whirled around to see his slender legs disappearing into my open patio doors. I ran after him. \"Hey! You can't just barge into people's homes like that!\" I said. He seemed to be paying me no attention. He was examining his reflection in the hallway mirror, making cartoonish expressions at himself. \n",
            "   \n",
            "\"Well, could've been worse I suppose,\" he said. \"Although I wish I wasn't so blurry.\" He whirled around to me. \"So, ready to give me those car keys?\" he asked. \n",
            "   \n",
            "\"Oh no, no way. First of all, I don't even know who you are! Second, you're in no shape to drive. You can't even see clearly!\" \n",
            "   \n",
            "He frowned at me and then held up one long, thin finger. \"I'm the Doctor.\" He added another digit, his fingers forming a peace sign. \"I suppose you're right. Never actually learned to drive....can you help me?\" I stared at him for a second, mulling over whether or not he could be trusted, his emerald eyes staring into mine. \n",
            "  \n",
            "\"Okay,\" I finally said. His face lit up. \"Great!\" he said, walking back towards the patio. \"This way\" I said, pulling him by the collar.

Far too many Walmart employees number among the \"hungry in America\", drawing food stamps and other aid just to get by.  Also, as I note elsewhere, it appears the majority of this charitable contribution is the expired foodstuffs from their store shelves which they'd have to write off as a loss anyway, being touted around at its full retail value for the sake of good press.  While donating it to food banks rather than throwing it out is a wonderful thing, you can't give it the same weight as you would a commitment to donate $2 billion to charity from the company coffers; the bulk of this act of charity won't be affecting the company's bottom line whatsoever.  It's a low opportunity cost gesture with a high return in good PR, and I sincerely doubt it's an accident they've done this hot on the heels of the recent bad national press surrounding the distribution center strike. negativereaction answer                          label: negativereaction                prediction: answer\n",

Tank nation wants the raps to be terrible now because thats the only way to build a team. Sure building through FA has its downsides (see Lakers and Nets) but building through the draft is no guarantee (ask any true clippers fan that was there for every single rebuild, ask the Wolves fans how building through the draft works, hell ask the Cavs fans, who have Irving and still are struggling). Even if you land a blue chipper, they have to be a top 5 player in the NBA to carry a crappy team (Like Rose with the Bulls (sorry bulls fans, its true), LBJ with the Cavs, Iverson with the sixers.) Tank nation doesn't want to be stuck in the middle, yet there are countless cases where one superstar isn't enough. Raptors tank and whoever they grab isn't LBJ 2.0, then in 4 years he will leave the team and I guarantee no one who was on board for the tank will apologize for being stupid and \"looking long term.\" They will just want to tank again. Before you pick a side, look at NBA history. Look what recent teams have done to build up teams. You can get lucky in the draft (Spurs with Duncan, OCK with Westbrook and Durant) or FA (Miami with LBJ) or hell even trades (Houston with Harden and Howard).

My rationale was not that I couldn't afford the 1100-1500, but rather that I wasn't particularly comfortable with supporting breeding. These cats don't happen by accident and currently there are no Northern California rescues for sphynxies because they are in high enough demand that people will still pay hundreds for altered adults who have been retired from breeding.

They're also prone to eye and skin problems. If you \"don't have a lot of money\" but you have your heart set on getting a pet, a sphynx is just a really poor fit for you. Reputable breeders will not even sell to you if you do not have a strong enough income to properly care for the animal in the highly likely event that the cat has health issues. Seriously, check out applications through some of the catteries around California. They want to make sure the animals are going to good homes where they will have the care they need.\n",

Knock Off is the best move in the metagame (I almost always run two mon with Knock Off on my teams) and is particularly important to sweepers like Fletch and Zig, who greatly appreciate opposing Eviolites and Berry Juices removed.  I would highly recommend Knock Off over Shell Smash on Dwebble (again, assuming you're using the above set) since you're using Dwebble to support another mon's sweep, rather that trying to sweep with it.\n",

If you find that you generally use Fletchling as a lure (with Overheat), scout/pivot (with U-Turn), or a means to weaken stuff for Zigzagoon later, you might actually want to consider Berry Juice to give the burd some staying power.  Since itemless is usually a much better option for Fletch, you should do some experimenting to see if you need Fletch to switch into attacks and/or Stealth Rock frequently before making the change.  If you want to keep Acrobatics at 110 base power from the get-go, you could replace Swords Dance with Roost, since Zig will presumably be doing the boosting later.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, I recommend dropping Porygon and adding fast pivot Mienfoo (EV spread in the original comment).  This thing makes almost any team better, without exaggeration.  Regenerator and Drain Punch means it can stick around for the whole match while repeatedly switching in to check threats.  It can switch in on Knock Offs (Porygon absolutely cannot, and Snubble needs its Berry Juice), and almost nothing wants to come in on Foo's Knock Off, since most of Foo's switch-ins usually need their Eviolite or Berry Juice to check other threats.  U-Turn is the last manditory move on this set, pairing with Regenerator to pivot at will.  Fourth move is totally customizable; Taunt shuts down slower hazard leads and, if you predict the switch-in, stops Foongus (Spore), Snubble (T-Wave), and Cottonee (lots of status moves, including Memento) from statusing whatever you switch to next.  Acrobatics can be very useful, since Mienfoo will often be taking Knock Offs; use this move if you have trouble dealing with opposing Mienfoo.  Fake Out is especially useful against Sash Abras that sacrifice Protect for a 4th coverage move.  Stone Edge surprises Flying types.  Finally, Poison Jab is highly situational, but it can work if you really struggle with Fairies.  I think your team could really benefit from Mienfoo's incredible utility of being able to do so many things with one set - staying alive through most of the match, Knocking Off items on mon that stand in your sweepers' way, U-Turning against switches to bring one of your frail mon in safely, the freedom to run whichever 4th move your team needs, and the added benefit of bringing Fighting typing (which is really good in LC) to your team. elaboration answer                          label: elaboration                prediction: answer\n",

We knew that he had a purple heart for being hit by flak- what I didn't realize is just how much action he saw. According to records he flew 51 combat missions out of Northern Africa and Italy. Given my affinity for combat flight sims its made me think about the reality for my Grandfather and the bomber crews in these eras. They were flying at 20-30,000ft in an unpressurized cabin, and in many ways were sitting ducks for Axis fighters to shoot at. Even more insane is that he joined up at 19 years of age. So to tie it all in with flight sims, anybody know of a combat sim that allows you to fly a B-24? Last I knew the only recently updated one was Warbirds which I'm not terribly fond of.

            "\n",
            "You better believe it! I've seen very great players in Platinum doing exceptionally well with exactly the \"normal\", \"gold\" 1-shot Widow. And i know why. It's not too complex, but takes some space to explain... But, first there was even simpler consideration: by the time any relatively new player gets Widow X, most URs are at level 1...3, and will remain so for rather long while. Now if you'd do to the great table you linked and if you'd check \"multi-clip reload-cancel DPS\" of Widow X vs Ur sniper rifles at levels 1...3 - you will see that Widow is already way ahead. But back to why Widow really rocks, now! See, the Widow has native piercing in it, for 1 meter. And \"Native\" piercing means that there will NOT be any damage penalty when it hits something \"behind\" a wall / plating / shield / cover. It will do full 100% of its damage. This where that \"most\" word actually comes from: very few URs have similar ability, namely Javelin and Black Widow, though with the latter, its native penetration is reduced to 0.25 meters thick things only, i.e. 4 times less full-damage penetration distance than the Widow. \"Most\" other URs, sniper rifles and other types, - don't have this. And thus they are prone to that \"30% less damage\" and \"40% less damage\" you can see on all sorts of armor-piercing weapon mods. As for armor-piercing ammo - yes, that comes without such a damage penalty, but Warp ammo has higher damage bonus in it even without any biotic ability affecting your target, and MUCH higher while there is some biotic thing on your target. This is how that 1-meter \"native\" Widow penetration ends up being rather special factor allowing to get more punch than \"simple\" DPS numbers \"on paper\". Oh, and also, native penetration does not prevent any _additional_ penetration from being effective, - when combined, it works in most perfect way, afaik: 1st meter of \"solid thing\", Widow will pierce with its \"native\" penetration, hitting anything \"not dead yet\" for 100% of its damage, and then further \"within some solid thing\" distance the bullet will go through as well for the distance listed on whatever extra penetration source you used with the Widow, and in this part applying corresponding damage penalty. Means Widow penetrates 0.75 thicker objects than Black Widow would, everything else being the same, - and full 1 meter thicker objects than most other guns. Extra damage you get from that when you place your shots well is hard to quantify, but skilled player, knowing all this and with practice, will be able to do quite much more than \"pure numbers\" would suggest, you know? ;)\n",

            "About Striker: yes, yes, details. Use Turian, extra stability from gear, and use cover as much as humanly possible (shooting from cover, especially full \"standing up\" cover, improves stability much).

Ergo, what else can do in \"sniper rifle\" department as well as CSR can do, if for any reason the player is not happy going Widow (nor any other \"signle shot\" rifle)? Quite a few classes have specific +sniper_rifle damage bonuses, you know. Plus the CSR has unlimited ammo. Plus it has IMHO excellent balance between damage per shot and rate of fire - very flexible, allowing you to do sheer DPS, or just finish nearly-dead enemies, and mix both kinds, without spending extra damage to \"overkill\" any much, and with great rate of fire. Thus for quite many players and some play styles / kits, it's indeed the best gun (until high-level URs, that is), me thinks. \n",

In between them lies another sub-gradient, the souls of the original two, Anui-El and Sithis. As per usual, these two serve as direct opposites, these being everything and nothing. Sithis is nothing itself, the infinite emptiness too absurd for our perceptions. Within Sithis is nothing, but we, as mere mortals, cannot comprehend true nothing. We are too far removed from Sithis to understand, I believe the Ada can understand it, but not us. Try and imagine nothing. What do you see? An infinite blackness, I assume. But that is nothing, it is still an image of blackness. You cannot imagine nothing, our minds are too simple. Sithis, as we've said, cannot be directly perceived, but the result of it can. Some claim that Sithis was the first, which is a believable idea, for what can come before everything but nothing? And the only thing that can come before nothing is nothing. Nothing gave way for everything, where stasis and change could fuel time and space, and all of the Aurbis could function. In the Dawn, we know there was no time, so Sithis came from Padomay, but also emerged at the same time. Perhaps Sithis really is the start of the house.

            "Starting with Musclemass, this power greatly increases Alex's strength with his fists, not to mention that he can also throw things MUCH further and much harder. As already established, Alex's fist abilities are very diverse and very good. In Round 1 I forgot to mention the body surf, which is an incredible attack, especially when you realize Alex can also launch Heller away from him once he hits him (with Flipkick Launcher). Afterwards, he can grab an object and throw it at Heller, who is now really far away from Alex. It makes for a deadly sequence of events seeing as many of Alex's unarmed attacks can knock Heller away, giving him free time to throw cars or whatnot at Heller. I'd also like to remind people that Cannonball is a thing, which one-shots helicopters in Prototype 1 if you have Musclemass on.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tendrils on the other hand are also very powerful. I'll assume Alex will respond to tendrils the same way that the Evolved do in Prototype 2, although I will assume that Alex will get webbed up by the tendrils if Heller hits him cleanly (this is not the case with the Evolved). Alex has the range with Palm Slam to zone out Heller to a certain extent. Palm Slam's range is roughly that of a standard tendril attack. The meat of Tendril's danger is from the Black Hole attack. It has massive range and will deal with Alex pushing Heller away reasonably well. As such, Alex being able to throw things isn't entirely free. \n",
            "\n",
            "This round will come down to whether Alex can succesfully keep out Heller. Up-close, while Alex has very good abilities to keep Heller away, Tendrils could web him up, after which Heller can do real damage to Alex. From Heller's perspective, his job is to stay close to Mercer and use Black Hole if he gets too far away from Alex.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'd say this is either a **5/10 or 6/10 for Mercer**, not sure which. Alex has his air kick imto Body Surf into Flipkick Launcher into throwing stuff which is really good, but Heller could could perhaps catch that with a raw tendril or Black Hole. In any case, it's close.\n",

            "\n",
            "Alright this round is the real match. Right off the bat, there's some very important things to keep in mind. Alex can now use Blade, which is probably his best power. It deals very high damage, especially his aerial attack. His heavy attack is three very quick slices that deal good damage and can be very useful if Heller ever slips up. \n",
            "\n",
            "Most notably though, Alex has his Armor. I've tested it in game and I'd say that Armor reduces Alex's damage taken by about 50%. This means that many of Heller's light attacks will be a lot less effective. Heller will have to resort to his big guns to deal any significant damage to Mercer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Heller on he other hand also gets a really powerful defensive tool: his Shields. Heller can use this to counter Mercer's blows quite reliably. I will slightly nerf the Shields for this fight though, as in-game, you could pretty much use the shield counter all day and stomp any boss or high level enemy, including the in-game Mercer fight. I'll make it so that Heller does have to put some thouts into his counters and can be punished for it if it misses. If I didn't include this nerf, this fight would easily go to Heller because shield counter is OP.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another thing tomkeep in mind is that Heller now has Bio-bombs, which are legit powerful. Heller can grab any infected from the Red Zone, bio-bomb 'em and throw them at Alex. This will do a lotmof damage against him, so he'll have to be very careful with the infected in the neighborhood. A response to Heller doing Bio-bombs is for Alex to quickly take a corner and consume some infected to regain his health. If Heller notices Alex doing that, he himself will consume some dudes as well. For this reason, I think Heller will only try one attempt at bio-bombing Alex, after which he'll immediately give chase.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, we have the Devastators and Pack Leader. Alex's devastators themselves are far superior to the one that Heller has, most notably his Tendril Blast thingy, where he shoots a ton of tendrils from his hands right at the opponent. This is Alex's most powerful attack and it does INSANE amounts of damage. If Heller ever gets hit hy it, he'll likely lose like half his health. Alex also has Tendril Barrage as a fantastic AoE move that also does good damage. I don't think Alex will use Groundspike Graveyard, as it can be easily avoided by Heller and punished with something like his Hammerfist air heavy, dealing a lot of damage to Alex.\n",
            "\n",
            "Heller's devastator is something he won't be using. It doesn't do enough damage to make it worth it, especially when Alex has armor on. No, he'll be using his Pack Leader. This summons several (let's say 3) pretty powerful Brawlers for James to send at Alex. This'll provide a powerful distraction, while Heller can use his Whipfist or Tendrils to attack from long range, while Alex is busy with the Brawlers.\n",
            "\n",
            "All things taken together, I'm surprised that Heller can actually put up a good fight against Mercer. He has the strength to back it up and abilities to match. However... Alex has armor. Armor is incredible for Alex's survivability, allowing him to tank a lot more hits than Heller may be prepared for. It hits his mobility sure, but if Heller decides to flee, Mercer can switch out his Armor for his own Shield, while still having good mobility.\n",

            "So round 6, I'm gonna have to say **Alex Mercer 7/10.** I totally expected it to be like 9/10 Alex beforehand, but after playing a bunch of Prototype 2, Heller's powers are a lot more powerful than I remembered. Pack Leader and Shields are a massive help for dealing with Alex. However, Armor is just too damn powerful. It makes many of Heller's attacks pointless because they just won't do enough damage. Heller can take 3/10 if he uses Pack Leader optimally and Mercer doesn't learn how to deal with Shields.

            "Sounds to me as if you don't understand component level mechanics. This isn't how RAM is used, even IF leveraged by software. ECC, and Non-ECC RAM will page off any data not physically being accessed or cached by higher level functions. While BDO does leverage caching over paging relatively more than any other game (thus lack of loading screens) it can NOT simple dynamically allocate caching based upon availability. This is managed by the OS. Not the component nor the software. The OS will access more RAM as paging requires, and only then. If that was not the case then hard-limits would have to exist on all software, indexing, services, PIDS, and OS level interactions otherwise they will cut out the middle man, over-allocate and cause system instability (resulting in a BSOD) Which they can not. That middle man the OS communicates with the enumerated API's and allocates dynamically needed memory, and then releases via paging operations back to the HDD/SDD for read/write operations. Furthermore excessive amounts of data cached onto RAM increases probability of hard-faulting, and excessive paging also known as the infamous \"Memory-Leak\". This is why from an SQA perspective allowing anything to access more RAM than is needed has catastrophic effects on performance (Better to page it back for read/write, then re-query the data from storage for a fresh digital handshake). Memory Leaks are usually a result of the OS being queried for data from the RAM or Page operation, and the OS is unable to locate the physical location of the data, thus it re-allocates a duplicate set of data to the RAM again. This can occur many-times over up to the point of hitting all available RAM pooling. Memory leaks are not always caused by the requesting software (in this case BDO) - It can be caused by the OS, GPU, RAM, Software, Driver, Controller, I/O differential, PIDS, BG Services, ect. The best thing i'd recommend is open task manager > Go to performance > Reasource monitor > RAM > Sort by hard faults > observe the PID fault rate. If BDO is faulting over 50 faults, check all PID's if multiple are faulting AT ALL (Anything above 0) then you know it's not BDO, you have some sort of intermedium issue. If only BDO is faulting, i would reinstall (Clean, uninstall, run CCleaner, reinstall) - Or go 1 step further, create a new VHD, or partition and only install BDO on that partition. If the problem persists, start removing RAM sticks, and observe til you locate the bad boy. If all RAM sticks are causing the issue, then i'd wage a bad I/O controller. \n",

I would build houses, and the people would reproduce. I would end up with more children than I could handle. Since children don't do anything, you don't want to have too many of them, other wise the adults won't be able to provide for them. Once the first starving/freezing citizen hit, I panicked, because I knew what was coming. However, I did the wrong thing and made it worse. I thought, \"Oh no, the people need food, I need to make more ___\", which makes sense in one way, but it doesn't in another. It hit me after 7 tries; if I can't provide for what I have, why am I expanding to try and fix it? Take it slow, and don't rush expansion. Build up what you need before you decide to expand also.

            "Since being shut out in back-to-back games at the end of March, New York has rebounded with a strong four-game stretch to re-establish itself in playoff position. The Rangers beat the Jets, took three of four points in a home-and-home with the Penguins and continued their three-game road trip with a 4-1 win in Carolina on Saturday. The final score is deceiving, as Lundqvist turned in a masterful 48-save performance, including 14 during a scoreless first period and 21 more in the third as the Hurricanes frantically tried to come back. Derek Stepan and Rick Nash scored power-play goals.\n",

            "\"With our energy level the way it was tonight, we needed him to do that,\" said center Brad Richards, who set up Stepan's goal. \"Who knows where we would have been without him. That's why we're happy to have him.\"\n",

I would have your best surviving players on the top totem due to this. Make sure everyone runs to the middle once they are done linking their totems  and if you have any, get your hunters/warlocks to make their pet go to the centre once phase begins, if they are anywhere else they can chain to people who don't want to be hit by the lightning.

I was living there with my dad a few years ago and he was working at this nursing home as an LPN that used to be an orphanage. He said the patients would sometimes talk about seeing a little boy. They called him Raleigh and they never acted afraid - they acted like they'd known him forever (except for one.) The first few times dad brushed it off, until he noticed a pattern. Everyone that \"saw\" him would pass away within 24 hours. The details they described were all the same - red headed, wearing brown clothes and about 10 years old. The one exception was a woman that came to visit her mother; She saw Raleigh peeking out from the closet. She came up to my father (I was visiting him and heard the whole conversation) and demanded to know why there was a little boy in her mother's closet. She was extremely upset about it. My dad asked her what he looked like and she told him red hair, 10 years old with brown clothes. His face went white, but he assured her he would check it out. She turned and left after that conversation. Dad found out from her mother she died in a car accident later that day. \n",

            "Sometimes things follow me home. I don't know why, they just do. This happened about a year ago. After leaving my friend Jessica's apartment (which are very, very old) I walked to my car and I felt funny, like someone was watching me. I brushed it off and got in the car. The whole way, I still felt someone watching me. I got about 2 miles from my house and I suddenly felt very drained. It was all I could do to keep my eyes open. I made it home alright and crawled into bed. I don't remember what I all I dreamed, the only thing I can remember is this man. He was tall and thin with a red flannel shirt. The disturbing thing is, his mouth was very large. Like the corner of his lips were a few inches from his ears and he kept smiling at me. The next day my friend Lewis came over. We got bored and figured we would go over to Jessica and Mike's. I was in the bathroom fixing my hair and getting ready to leave. I heard this growling from the living room, which couldn't have been an animal because I didn't have any pets at the time. I kept yelling at my friend to knock it off and he kept saying it wasn't him. I didn't believe him until he walked into the bathroom and it was still growling in the living room. The man kept coming to mind. I could still see him so clearly in my head. I was definitely creeped out but I composed myself and we left for our friend's apartment. When we got there, everything was cool. Jessica was playing fable, Mike and Lewis started torturing the cat by throwing a ball with catnip in it back and forth in the hallway. I passed by them to get to the bathroom and as I was coming out, Jessica started screaming. The three of us bolted down the hallway. She was sitting on the couch, her hands covering her face. The picture on the screen was shaking and the colors and sound were heavily distorted, but we could make out the game music in the background, but there was this deep, unintelligible, inhuman voice coming out. We all were silently staring for about a minute. It abruptly stopped and the game was back to normal. Nothing weird happened for the rest of the night.\n",
